## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher on CSS styling and becoming reacquainted with Flexbox. Centering the content on the page becomes much easier using Flexbox. I also practiced importing fonts of specific weights from Google Fonts.


### Continued development

I would like to keep practicing Flexbox and start working on Grid to become more comfortable with using both for my layouts.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I was referencing W3Schools often to help refresh my knowledge on different types of CSS stylings.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container) - This site helped me to align items in a flex container.
